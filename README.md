# Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript 

When we write TypeScript code, sometimes we need to describe the shape of an object ‚Äî like what properties(types) it will have.

To do that, we can use:

* interface

* type

### 1. Adding More Features

üî∏ Interface:
You can extend an interface easily. That means you can create a new interface that builds on top of an old one.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Student extends Person {
  roll: number;
}

```
Here, Student is using all the things from Person, and also adding its own thing roll.

üî∏ Type:
You can also extend a type, but the way is a bit different. You have to use the & symbol (called ‚Äúintersection‚Äù).

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
};

type Student = Person & {
  roll: number;
};
```
So, both can be extended, but interface syntax is simpler for extending.

### 2. Declaration Merging
üî∏ Interface:
You can write the same interface more than once, and TypeScript will combine them.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Trisha",
  age: 23,
};
```
Here, both name and age work together ‚Äî no error!

üî∏ Type:
You cannot declare the same type twice. If you do, TypeScript will give an error.

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
};

type User = {
  age: number;
}; //  Error! Cannot declare 'User' again
```
So, interface supports merging, but type does not.

### 3. Use with Primitives and Unions

üî∏ Interface:
You can only use it for object shapes. You cannot use it for string, number, or for combining types using | (union).

```ts
interface Status = "active" | "inactive"; // Not allowed
```
üî∏ Type:
You can use type for anything ‚Äî not just objects. You can define simple values or combine types.
```ts
type Status = "active" | "inactive"; // Allowed
type ID = string | number;
```
So, type is more flexible.

### üîπ Differences:

| Feature                        | Interface                             | Type                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Extending                     | Can extend multiple interfaces         | Can extend types using intersections |
| Declaration Merging           | Supports (can be redeclared)           | Does **not** support merging         |
| Use with Primitives/Unions    | Not allowed                            | Allowed                              |

### Example: Interface

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Extending interface
interface Admin extends User {
  role: string;
}

const admin: Admin = {
  name: "Sanjida",
  age: 23,
  role: "Super Admin"
};

```
### Example: Type
```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

// Union type using `type`
type Status = "active" | "inactive";

// Intersection with another type
type Admin = User & {
  role: string;
};

const admin: Admin = {
  name: "Trisha",
  age: 23,
  role: "Moderator"
};

```

# 2. The use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript
The keyof keyword is a powerful tool in TypeScript that returns a union of property names from a type or interface. It‚Äôs commonly used in generic programming and utility types.
Some reason to use keyof keyword:

* To make code safer and smarter.

* To avoid using wrong property names by mistake.

* To build reusable functions that work with many object types.

Syntax:
```ts
keyof TypeName

```

### Basic Use
Let‚Äôs say we have an object type called Person:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent: boolean;
};
```
If we write:

```ts
type PersonKeys = keyof Person;
```
Now PersonKeys will be:

```ts
// "name" | "age" | "isStudent"
```
That means: PersonKeys is a union of all the keys in the Person type.
Example 1: Basic keyof Usage

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserKeys = keyof User; // "id" | "name" | "email"

function getUserProperty(user: User, key: UserKeys) {
  return user[key];
}

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Trisha",
  email: "trisha@example.com"
};

console.log(getUserProperty(user, "email")); // "trisha@example.com"
```
This ensures that you can only pass valid keys like "id", "name", or "email" ‚Äî no invalid access like "address".

Example 2: keyof with Generics

```ts
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2024
};

const model = getProperty(car, "model"); // Type is string
console.log(model); // "Corolla"

```

Using keyof with generics helps build flexible, reusable, and safe functions for object access.
